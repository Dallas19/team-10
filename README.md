## Challenge Statement

The challenge is to build a platform that can help United Way efficiently view and analyze complex data models in a longitudinal and/or year-to-date format. There should be multiple visualizations views to represent the data for different users (i.e. general public v. stakeholder meetings) and to compare performance data against performance targets.
